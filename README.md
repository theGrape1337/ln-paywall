# Blog paywall start

This is the starting code for the youtube tutorial Bitcoin Paywall with LN in React (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OAHIbGTA-Q)

## Install npm packages

When you have cloned the project you first need to run install npm in the root folder.

### `npm install`

## Start the blog

In the project directory first run:

### `npm run server`

This will start the simple json server with the posts (see json.db file in root folder).

Then, in a new terminal also in the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Which launches the web app on localhost:3000
